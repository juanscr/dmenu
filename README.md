# dmenu
In this repository, my own build of the dmenu suckless utility can be found.
This build is minimal in the sense that few patches were applied to preserve the
simplicity for this tool. The build has the following specifications:

- It has a line height parameter in order to change the size for compliance with
  the size of the panel. In my case, it has the exact parameter to work with my
  polybar build.
- Highlighting the match for a more visually pleasant search.
- A color scheme based in the Dracula color scheme.

Build based on __dmenu 5.0__
